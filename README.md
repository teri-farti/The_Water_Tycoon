# The Water Tycoon

The Water Tycoon is a Bedrock tycoon‑style map focused on water extraction, filtration, and distribution in a drought‑affected region of Africa.
The project is built as an engineering‑oriented experience with carefully designed systems, unique mechanics, and a strong social‑environmental theme.

The map is developed for Minecraft Bedrock Edition and is intended for future publication on the Minecraft Marketplace.
Vision

The goal of this project is to create a socially meaningful gameplay experience that combines:

-Economic strategy and resource management

-A realistic model of water extraction and purification

-Interactive worker systems (extractors, filters, couriers)

-Progression, upgrades, and infrastructure expansion

-Visual and technical quality matching Marketplace standards

The project is developed as a portfolio map, showcasing skills in add‑on development, animation, system design, and game architecture.
